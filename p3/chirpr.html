	<p>Artist's Statement: This is a parody bot of the UCSC Dining services. It announces a fake menu of food that is being served for the day. It also occasionally will anounce the closing of a random dining hall. If the user reply contains a food we announced as being served, the bot will reply saying they are all out of that food. If the user replies with any other food (that exists in the grammar), then it will tell them we aren't serving that food.</p>
